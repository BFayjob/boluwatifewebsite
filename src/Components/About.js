          Expanding my horizons, I ventured into cloud technologies, hosting the web app on AWS and Google Firebase. Despite this diverse skill set, my heart remains in cybersecurity. I aspire to evolve into a Cloud Security Engineer, blending innovative problem-solving with a deep understanding of cybersecurity.
